𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝟮: 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝗡𝗬𝗖 𝗔𝗶𝗿𝗯𝗻𝗯 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮)

𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲:

To clean the NYC Airbnb dataset by addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, and optimizing data for analysis.

𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘁:

The dataset includes 48,895 entries with 16 attributes such as room type, price, and neighborhood.

𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀:

Handling Missing Values: Imputed or removed missing data for critical fields like reviews and host names.

Outlier Detection: Used the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and remove outliers in the price column.

Data Standardization: Standardized text data for consistency and optimized data types for efficiency.

Duplicates Removal: Ensured data integrity by removing duplicate rows.


𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀:

Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy
